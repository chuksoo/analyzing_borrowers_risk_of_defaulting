**Project description** <br>
Your project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. You’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.

Your report will be considered when building a **credit score** for a potential customer. A **credit score** is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.
